    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
Privacy Policy<br />Last updated: February 25, 2024<br /><br />Shalzuth LLC
("us", "we", or "our") operates supervive.io (the "Site"). This page informs you
of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal
Information we receive from users of the Site.<br /><br />We use your Personal
Information only for providing and improving the Site. By using the Site, you
agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this
policy.<br /><br />Information Collection And Use<br />While using our Site, we
may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that
can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may
include, but is not limited to your name ("Personal Information").<br /><br />We
may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site.
These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name,
address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other
Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of
interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to
know your choices about not having this information used by these companies,
click here.<br /><br />Log Data<br />Like many site operators, we collect
information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site ("Log Data").<br /><br />This
Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol
("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Site that you
visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other
statistics.<br /><br />In addition, we use third party services such as Google
Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this.<br /><br />Cookies<br />We
use cookies to store information for your convenience ("Settings"). We also may
use third party advertisements on the Site. Some of these advertisers may use
technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on the Site,
which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google
AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser
you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.
This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate
ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on
specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents
cooking sites).<br /><br />You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our
cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing
preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can
greatly affect how you are able to interact with the Site as well as most other
websites.<br /><br />Security<br />The security of your Personal Information is
important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet,
or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use
commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
guarantee its absolute security.<br /><br />Children's Online Privacy Protection
Act<br />Minors and children should not use the Site. By using the Site, you
represent that you have the legal capacity to enter into a binding
agreement.<br /><br />The Site does not knowingly collect or store any Personal
Information from children under thirteen (13) in the United States or under the
relevant age threshold in other jurisdictions where the child is located. If you
are under thirteen (13) years old in the United States, or under the relevant
age threshold in the jurisdiction where you are located, you cannot use the Site
without the permission of your parent or guardian.<br /><br />We may collect

of our internal operations from all users of the Site. If parents or guardians
believe that we have unintentionally collected their children's other Personal
Information or otherwise used their children's Personal Information, please
contact us.<br /><br />Users in the European Economic Area<br />The Site only
processes or transfers your Personal Information where we can rely on legal
grounds and appropriate safeguards to do so. You also have additional rights
regarding your Personal Information if you are located in the European Economic
Area ("EEA"). The Site takes commercially reasonable measures to safeguard your
privacy rights in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br /><br />Your Personal
Information may be transferred to and processed in various countries. Before we
transfer your Personal Information to third parties based outside the EEA, we
ensure either: (i) the use of European Commission approved contract clauses to
protect your Personal Information; or (ii) we are only transferring your
Personal Information to trusted countries that achieve the approved standards
for Personal Data protection set forth by the European Commission. By using the
Site, you must consent to the international transfer procedures and guidelines
set forth above, if you do not, please refrain from using the Site at this
time.<br /><br />For California Residents: CCPA Information<br />This Privacy
Notice for California Residents supplements the information contained elsewhere
in this Privacy Notice and applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who
reside in the State of California ("consumers" or "you"). We adopt this notice
to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) and any terms
defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this notice.<br /><br />Rights
and Choices<br />The CCPA provides consumers located in the state of California
with certain rights regarding their personal information and data. The following
section describes those rights and explains how to exercise them:<br /><br />Access
to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights<br />You have the right to
request that the company disclose certain information to you about our
collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once

within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:<br /><br />Provide

about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.<br />Describe
your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand,
evaluate, and respond to it.<br />We cannot respond to your request or provide
you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to
make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.<br /><br />Making
a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request
to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.<br /><br />Information
